# Beginner Course: Image Analysis for Biologists

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Image Analysis for Biologists** beginner course! This course is designed for biological Master's students with little to no programming experience, to teach the basics of microscopy image analysis using Python. We will use open-source tools: **Python** (via the Anaconda distribution) and **Jupyter Notebooks** for coding, with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our development environment. All coding will be done in Python, and we’ll utilize common image processing libraries (such as OpenCV and scikit-image) to analyze microscopy images. In our examples, we will work with fluorescence microscopy images – for instance, a DAPI channel (nuclei stain) and a second channel with an immunofluorescence (IF) or single-molecule FISH (smFISH) signal. By the end of this course, you will know how to set up your Python environment, load and visualize images, perform basic image processing, and analyze simple two-channel microscopy data.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **A Windows or macOS computer** with an internet connection.
- **Anaconda Python Distribution** – This will install Python and helpful scientific libraries, and allow you to manage environments easily. (We will go through the installation steps below.)
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – A source-code editor that we will use to write code and run Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Git** – A version control system for tracking changes in your code and syncing with GitHub. Having Git will allow you to download the course materials and save your work. (If Git is not installed, VS Code’s Source Control panel will prompt you with instructions.)
- **GitHub account (optional)** – If you plan to push your notebooks or code to a GitHub repository (for backup or sharing), you should have a free GitHub account.

No advanced programming knowledge is required. Basic familiarity with using your computer’s command line or terminal is helpful but not mandatory – we will guide you through every step. Now, let’s get your environment set up!

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to install the necessary software and set up your environment on Windows or Mac:

### 1. Install Anaconda (Python Distribution)

**Download Anaconda:** Visit the official [Anaconda downloads page](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and download the latest **Anaconda Distribution** for your operating system (Windows or macOS). Choose the Python 3.x version (64-bit). On Windows, this will be a `.exe` installer; on Mac, a `.pkg` installer. The Anaconda distribution comes with Python and most common scientific libraries (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-image, etc.) pre-installed, which is why we prefer it for this course.

**Run the Installer:** Once downloaded, run the installer. On Windows, double-click the `.exe` and proceed through the setup wizard:
- It’s recommended to install for “Just Me” (no admin required) when prompted.
- You can accept the default install location. 
- **Important:** During installation, you may see an option “Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable.” You can check this to enable using `conda`/`python` from any terminal, but it’s optional. If unsure, leave it unchecked (Anaconda will be accessible via the Start Menu or Anaconda Prompt).
- Proceed and click “Install” to complete the setup. Agree to any terms if prompted.

On macOS, open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the prompts. You might need to approve the installer in System Preferences if you get a security warning. The installer will guide you through the steps (agree to the license, choose install location, etc.). After installation, you can delete the installer file.

**Verify the Installation:** After installation, you should have an **Anaconda3** (or simply Anaconda) folder on your system. On Windows, open the **Anaconda Prompt** (find it in your Start menu) and type `conda --version` to check that conda is installed. On Mac, open the Terminal app and type `conda --version`. If a version number appears without error, you’re all set. (If not, you may need to restart your terminal or ensure Anaconda’s path is initialized – e.g., by running `source ~/.bashrc` or `conda init` on Mac. Typically, the installer does this for you.)

### 2. Install Visual Studio Code

Download **Visual Studio Code** from the official website ([code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)) and install it for your platform:
- **Windows:** Download the installer `.exe`, run it, and follow the setup wizard (accept the agreement, choose install location, and select options if you want shortcuts or adding to PATH, then install).
- **macOS:** Download the VS Code `.zip` or `.dmg`. For the `.zip`, unzip and drag the `Visual Studio Code.app` into your Applications folder. For `.dmg`, drag the app to Applications. You can then launch VS Code from Applications or Spotlight search.

**Install the Python extension:** Launch VS Code. On the first run, it might detect that you have Python installed and suggest the **Microsoft Python extension** – go ahead and install it (this provides rich Python support and Jupyter Notebook capabilities in VS Code). If it doesn’t prompt, open the Extensions view (click the Extensions icon on the left sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`), search for “Python” by Microsoft, and install it. This extension includes support for Jupyter notebooks in VS Code. *(You do not need to install Jupyter separately – Anaconda already includes Jupyter, and VS Code can interface with it natively.)*

### 3. Install Git (if you haven’t already)

Git is required to clone (download) the course repository and to version-control your work. 

- **Windows:** Download Git from the official site ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) and run the installer. You can accept the default settings. This will install Git and the Git Bash terminal.
- **macOS:** Git may already be installed (often via Xcode Command Line Tools). To check, open Terminal and run `git --version`. If it says git version and a number, you have it. If not, install Xcode Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install` in Terminal, or install Git via Homebrew (`brew install git`) or from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

After installing, you might need to restart VS Code for it to recognize Git. VS Code will show a warning in the Source Control panel if Git is not found, with a link to install it. Once Git is installed, VS Code will enable its source control features.

### 4. (Optional) Create a Python environment for the course

Anaconda allows you to create isolated **environments** for different projects. This is optional for this beginner course, but it’s a good practice to avoid messing up the base environment. You can use the base environment (the default) which already has many packages, or create a new one for this course:

- Open **Anaconda Prompt** (Win) or **Terminal** (Mac), and ensure it says `(base)` at the beginning of the line, meaning the base conda environment is active. If not, you can activate it with `conda activate base`.
- To create a new environment (let’s call it `bioimg`), run:  
```

conda create -n bioimg python=3.10 anaconda

```
This tells conda to create an env named “bioimg” with Python 3.10 and all the default Anaconda packages. You can omit `anaconda` at the end to create a minimal environment, but including it will preload many useful libraries. Feel free to use a different name or Python version if needed.
- Once created, activate the environment:  
```

conda activate bioimg

```
Your prompt should now show `(bioimg)` instead of `(base)`. From now on, this environment will be used for our course.

## Getting the Course Materials

The course materials (notebooks, sample images, etc.) are provided in a GitHub repository. You have two main ways to get these materials onto your computer:

- **Clone with Git:** If you are comfortable with Git, the simplest way is to “clone” the repository. Copy the repository URL (for example, using the green **Code** button on GitHub). Then, in a terminal or Anaconda Prompt, navigate to a folder where you want the course files to live, and run:  
```

git clone <repository-url>

````
Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YourUsername/ImageAnalysisCourse.git`). This will download all files into a new folder. You can also clone directly from VS Code by using the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows, `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and selecting **Git: Clone**, then entering the repository URL. VS Code will ask you to choose a local folder for the clone and then offer to open it.

- **Download ZIP:** If you prefer not to use Git, you can click the **Code** button on the GitHub page and choose **Download ZIP**. Then unzip the archive to a folder on your computer. (The downside is you won’t easily be able to update or sync changes, but it’s straightforward for a one-time setup.)

After cloning or extracting, you should have a folder containing the README (this file), and other folders like `data` (with sample images) and perhaps some initial notebooks or scripts.

## Opening the Project in VS Code

Now that you have the files, let’s open them in Visual Studio Code:

1. **Launch VS Code** and choose **File > Open Folder** (or **Open** on Mac) from the menu. Select the folder of the repository you just cloned/downloaded. This opens the project in VS Code. You should see the folder structure in VS Code’s Explorer panel.

2. **Trust the workspace:** If prompted about “Workspace Trust”, go ahead and **Trust** the folder. This course’s code is safe.

3. **Select the Python interpreter:** In VS Code, at the bottom left you should see the current Python interpreter (it might say `Python 3.x ... (base: conda)` or similar). Click that, or open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and type “Python: Select Interpreter”. Choose the Python environment you want to use (for example, the `bioimg` environment you created, or base). VS Code needs to use an environment that has Jupyter installed. If you installed Anaconda, the environment will already have the Jupyter package, so selecting the conda environment is enough. Once selected, VS Code will use that Python for running notebooks and scripts.

## Creating and Running Your First Jupyter Notebook

Now for the fun part – creating a Jupyter Notebook and running some code!

1. **Create a new Jupyter Notebook:** In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and select **“Jupyter: Create New Jupyter Notebook”**. Alternatively, click the **New File** icon and save it with a `.ipynb` extension, e.g., `intro.ipynb` – VS Code will recognize it as a notebook and open the notebook editor.

2. **Select a Kernel:** When the notebook opens, you might see “Select Kernel” or an indicator in the top-right. This refers to choosing which Python environment to run the notebook. Click it and choose the conda environment you set up (or the base environment) that has Python installed.

3. **Add a code cell:** A new notebook typically starts with one empty cell. If you need a new cell, you can click the “＋ Code” button or use the **+** icon that appears when you hover in the notebook. By default, the first cell is already available for input. Click inside the cell to start typing.

4. **Write a test command:** Let’s do a simple test. In the cell, type:  
 ```python
 print("Hello, world!")
````

This is a basic Python command that will print text.

5. **Run the cell:** To execute the code in a cell, click the **Run** button (a sideways triangle “Play” icon) to the left of the cell, or press `Shift+Enter` while the cell is selected. The cell will run, and the output will appear directly below the cell. In this case, you should see:

   ```
   Hello, world!
   ```

6. **Save your notebook:** Go to **File > Save** (or hit `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`). It’s good practice to save frequently. The notebook file (with `.ipynb` extension) contains your code, output, and any Markdown text you add.

## Course Outline

Here is a breakdown of the lessons in this course and what you will learn in each:

1. **Lesson 1: Introduction & Setup** – Verifying your Python/Anaconda installation, getting comfortable with VS Code and Jupyter Notebooks, and understanding the course dataset. We’ll ensure that you can open the sample microscopy images provided and print basic information (dimensions, type) about them.

2. **Lesson 2: Python and Image Basics** – A crash course on Python fundamentals and how they apply to image analysis. You’ll learn about working with arrays (using NumPy) since images are essentially arrays of pixels, and how to use libraries to read and display images. We will load the DAPI (nuclei) and IF/smFISH channel images in a notebook, visualize them (using matplotlib or the notebook’s image display), and discuss image representations (grayscale vs color, intensity values, etc.).

3. **Lesson 3: Processing and Segmenting Nuclei (DAPI channel)** – Focusing on the nuclei channel, we will cover basic image processing techniques. This includes filtering (to reduce noise), adjusting contrast, and **thresholding** the image to create a binary mask of nuclei. You will learn about automatic threshold methods (like Otsu’s method) to separate foreground (nuclei) from background. We’ll then perform **segmentation** to identify individual nuclei – for example, using connected component analysis to label each nucleus. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to count how many nuclei are in an image automatically.

4. **Lesson 4: Analyzing the IF/smFISH Signal** – In this lesson, we turn to the second channel (immunofluorescence or single-molecule FISH signal). We’ll apply similar basics: visualize the channel, possibly filter or enhance it, and then analyze the signal. Depending on the nature of the images, this could mean detecting **spots** (for smFISH, identifying individual RNA transcripts as bright dots) or measuring fluorescence **intensity** in certain regions. We will introduce methods for spot detection or intensity thresholding. You will practice counting spots or measuring average intensity in the image.

5. **Lesson 5: Multi-Channel Analysis** – Here we combine information from both channels. For example, using the nuclei segmented from DAPI (Lesson 3) as reference, we can measure per-nucleus signal from the IF/smFISH channel. This might involve overlaying masks, extracting pixel values of the second channel within each nucleus region, and computing statistics (e.g., how many smFISH spots or total intensity per nucleus). This lesson ties everything together to perform a simple **biological analysis**: you might answer questions like “How many RNA spots per cell?” or “What is the distribution of protein expression across cells?”.

6. **Lesson 6: Further Techniques and Wrap-up** – In the final part, we will explore a few additional techniques or discuss how to go further. This could include saving your analysis results to a file (CSV/excel), making plots of the results, or an introduction to more advanced image analysis concepts (such as edge detection, colocalization, or machine learning approaches) for those interested in continuing. We’ll also review what you learned, and point you to resources to deepen your knowledge.
