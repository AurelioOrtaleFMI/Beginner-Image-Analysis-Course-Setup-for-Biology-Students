# Lesson 1: Loading and Analyzing Microscopy Images

In this lesson, we will:

1. Load microscopy images from different formats.
2. Explore basic properties of images, including their shape and intensity.
3. Visualize the images to understand their content.

Microscopy images are usually represented as multi-dimensional arrays where each pixel holds a value representing some characteristic (like intensity). These images may have different channels (such as DAPI and IF), and the data may come in different file formats, such as `.stk` files or `.ome.tif`.

We will work with two common formats:
- **.nd + .stk**: A pair of files, where `.nd` contains metadata and `.stk` contains the image data.
- **.ome.tif**: A file format that combines both metadata and image data.

We will use the `tifffile` library to load `.ome.tif` files and `nd2` library to load `.stk` files. Let's begin by installing the necessary libraries.

```bash
!pip install nd2 tifffile matplotlib numpy


#### Code Section: Import Libraries
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tifffile
from nd2reader import ND2Reader
